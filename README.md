# clojurewm

Sick and tired of having no suitable window manager while working in Microsoft
Windows.

Inspired by xmonad, sroctwm, dwm, windawesome, Actual Window Manager,
python-windows-tiler, bug.n.

## Usage
### Alt-Shift K 
assign a hotkey to the currently focused window. The next key sequence
entered will be saved to the window.
    
## TODO
Lots.
* Improve this README.
* Multiple windows per hotkey.
* Configurable hotkey assignment hotkey (currently only Alt-Shift K).
* Command to display current hotkey list.
* Make release package.
* Bugs?
